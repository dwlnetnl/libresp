# RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) encoder and decoder for Arduino

This is a [RESP][1] encoder/decoder library I'm using to play with
Arduino-based thingies. [RESP][1] is standard C so it actually does not depend
on Arduino.

**Warning**: This project still lacks bechmarkis and it probably has some
security issues regarding how strings are decoded, so maybe this is not a good
time to use it in production.

## How to install (on Arduino)

Download the latest [.ZIP package][2] and follow the official instructions on
[importing a .ZIP library][3].
